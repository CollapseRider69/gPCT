# gPCT — Gravitational Phase-Cancellation Theory

**Canonical reference:**  
[*Slope Traversal and Time — A Minimal Statement of gPCT*]

gPCT proposes that **collapse symmetry is modulated by the local gravitational-phase slope** rather than static curvature, treating time, gravity, and quantum collapse as one differential recursion.

## Core relations (summary)
- `u^μ = dx^μ/dτ` (four-velocity), `D ≡ u^μ ∇_μ` (proper-time derivative)  
- `φ_g ∝ (c²/2) ln(-g_00)` (metric-derived phase potential), `s = Dφ_g` (slope)  
- **White Equation:** `H = DG − G D²G − (DG)² → 1/(2π)`  
- **Collapse probability:** `P(|1⟩) = cos²[(π/2)(s − 0.5)]`  
- **Temporal balance:** `∮_γ σ dτ = 0` (closed worldlines / complete phase cycles)
