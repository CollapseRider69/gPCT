# Gravitational Phase-Cancellation Theory (gPCT)

**Canonical reference:**  
[*Slope Traversal and Time — A Minimal Statement of gPCT*]

---

### Concept

gPCT proposes that **collapse symmetry is modulated by the local gravitational-phase slope**,  
rather than by static curvature. Time, gravity, and quantum collapse are treated as  
expressions of a single differential recursion.

### Core Relations

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|----------|
| \( u^\mu = dx^\mu/d\tau \) | four-velocity |
| \( D \equiv u^\mu\nabla_\mu \) | proper-time derivative |
| \( \phi_g \propto \tfrac{c^2}{2}\ln(-g_{00}) \) | gravitational-phase potential (metric-derived) |
| \( s = D\phi_g \) | local gravitational-phase slope |
| \( G \) | scalar gravitational amplitude (curvature scalar) |

### The White Equation

The internal recursion linking curvature, time, and collapse bias is expressed as

\[
H = DG - G D^2 G - (DG)^2 \;\longrightarrow\; \tfrac{1}{2\pi},
\]

where \(H\) tends toward a constant under phase-balanced traversal.  
This **White Equation** defines the self-referential evolution of curvature with respect to its own slope and underpins the cos² collapse law.

---

### Collapse Probability

\[
P(|1\rangle) = \cos^2\!\left[\tfrac{\pi}{2}(s - 0.5)\right],
\]

showing that measurement outcomes depend on the gravitational-phase slope \(s\).

---

### Temporal Balance

Over closed worldlines or complete phase cycles,

\[
\oint_\gamma \sigma\, d\tau = 0,
\]

establishing **global neutrality** of all local asymmetries.
